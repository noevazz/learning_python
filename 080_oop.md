###### The object-oriented approach

he object approach suggests a completely different way of thinking.
The data and the code are enclosed together in the same world, divided into classes.

Every class is like a recipe which can be used when you want to create a useful object (this is where the name of the approach comes from). You may produce as many objects as you need to solve your problem.

Objects are incarnations of classes,
in technical words:
objects are instances of classes

###### Class hierarchies
a class can inherit characteristics from another class,
the subclass (child) can also have sub classes (childre)
Class: features A, B
   subclass: features A, B, C, D, E
        subclas of subclass (inherit characteristics from everyone: : features A, B, C, D, E, F, G)

example:

class vehicle:
    def go_to(place):
        pass
    def etc():
        pass

class car(vehicle): # this sintax says that vehicle is the parent and car the subclass
    def more_features():
        pass

if we wan to create an obcjet we need to "instance" the class:
car1 = car()
car2 = car()

since carX are children of vehicle we can use its functions:
car1.go_to("home")
car2.go_to("school")
