# a certain project can be divided into two main parts: the user interface and the logic,
# Each of these parts can be (most likely) divided into smaller ones, and so on.
# Such a process is often called DECOMPOSITION.

# we can use modules to divide a piece of software into separate but cooperating parts

 # A (rather large) number of modules is delivered together with Python itself (Python standard library).
 # You can think of them as a kind of "Python extra equipment".
